# genshin-impact-ascension-mats

I'm tryin to create an app that lets users scroll and choose specific Genshin Impact characters.
If they click on a characters thumbnail it should open up with details of ascension materials needed on the right side of the main container.

set up
- install react into your machine
- cd into ascension-mats
- $ npm start
